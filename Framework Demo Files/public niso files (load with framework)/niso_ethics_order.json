  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Ethics Over Ideology across scales capture structural equivalences in ethical invariants, ideological variability, autonomy supremacy, justice equity, harm-benefit calculus, cultural pluralism, and striving synthesis—mappings where ethical relations preserve harmony invariances invariantly. Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates neural self-modeling (recursive ethics for consciousness analogs) and aesthetic adequacy (joyful supremacy through eternal striving) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical harmony; tetralemma probes resolve apparent relativisms (affirm ideology/deny dominance/both in synthesis/neither dissolved in ethical equivalence); scores ≥0.98 based on tool-validated empirics (e.g., UN rights vs. cultural relativism).",

    "Support sub-categories for compound concepts (e.g., justice with consciousness links).",
    "Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principle; integrate tool-grounded examples (e.g., web anchors for ethical debates).",
