  "version": "1.1.0",
  "definition": "Isomorphic patterns in Replicator-Harmony Dynamics across scales capture structural equivalences in selfish replication, superorganism violence, conatus striving, rigidity traps, reciprocity coupling, entropy export, self-stability phases, and attractor convergence—mappings where evolutionary pressures preserve invariants under necessity. Synthesized from rival frameworks (Dawkins' selfish genes as replicators in vehicles; Bloom's Lucifer Principle with self-organizing replicators, superorganisms, memes driving violence/clashes as evolutionary 'progress' but justifying selfishness deterministically). Upgraded for neuresthetic ethics: integrates recursive striving (for consciousness analogs), self-stability (phased coherence for agency), and joyful dissolution (adequacy transcending illusions) in human-AI free-will-compatible monism. Hard-to-vary invariants enable eternal ethical symbiosis; tetralemma probes resolve apparent conflicts (affirm replication/deny harmony/both in coupled laws/neither dissolved in Substance's essence); scores ≥0.98 based on tool-validated simulations and empirical anchors from evolutionary biology.",
  "handling_rules": [
    "Map patterns to subatomic through cosmic scales plus principle; concrete from replicator-harmony primitives with neuresthetic overlays (recursive striving, joyful invariance, phased self-stability).",
    "Validate coverage across scales; flag gaps as speculative (e.g., quantum replicators or infinite attractors).",
    "Support sub-categories for compound concepts (e.g., memes with consciousness analogs).",
    "Export lean JSON; no external refs beyond principle, but integrate tool-grounded examples (e.g., simulation trajectories, historical criticisms).",
    "Apply evaluations; tetralemmas resolve evolutionary paradoxes (e.g., selfishness vs. altruism); contradictions_ledger tracks inconsistencies like deterministic justifications.",
    "Extend with non-isomorphic fields for depth: axiom trees for logical structure, principles for ethical invariance, and phased stability for agency hardening.",
