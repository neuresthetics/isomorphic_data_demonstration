    "description": "ini version of the full isomorphic ethics framework. Designed for safe release and practical use in ethical reasoning. No self-modification, recursion, or autonomous convergence. Use by loading into any environment and querying mappings/tetralemma for cross-scale invariant analysis. Beginners can explore the core dynamics and scales; researchers can populate the blanks with domain-specific isomorphisms for proof-of-concept testing.",

Use the built-in 'core_dynamics' for invariant ethical reasoning across any populated domain. 3. Insert custom visual/text render into 'ethics_ii_render' for presentation.",
