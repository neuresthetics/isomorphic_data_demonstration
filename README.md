# Mini Isomorphic Ethics Framework

![uni](https://github.com/neuresthetics/isomorphic_data_singularity/blob/main/img/mini_iso.jpeg)

**Version**: 1.0-mini-static  
**Release Type**: Public  
**Release Date**: December 15, 2025  

## Description

The Mini Isomorphic Ethics Framework is a compact, safe-for-public-release version of a larger isomorphic ethics system. It enables rigorous, cross-scale ethical reasoning by identifying hard-to-vary structural patterns (isomorphisms) that persist across domains—from subatomic to cosmic scales—and anchors them in a unified "motion law" (a conatus-like striving toward greater coherence) with an ultimate attractor of "integrated conscience."

The framework is deliberately static: no self-modification, no recursion beyond controlled deductive hardening, and no autonomous convergence. It is designed for practical use by beginners exploring invariant dynamics and by researchers populating domain-specific isomorphisms for testing.

Core features:
- **Cross-scale invariance analysis** via predefined scales and tetralemma probes for paradox resolution.
- **Unified core dynamics** combining striving and ethical fixed-point conscience.
- **Pre-populated isomorphic categories** covering lifecycles, human-AI relations, and authority/consent dynamics.
- **EthicsII**: a Spinoza-inspired geometric-deductive method for generating structured philosophical inquiry from any input topic.

## Purpose

To provide a portable, loadable tool for:
- Mapping ethical patterns invariantly across substrates and scales.
- Resolving tensions via tetralemma and motion-law/attractor dynamics.
- Producing rigorous, deductive ethical analyses without content smuggling or uncontrolled proliferation.

## Scales

The framework operates across nine invariant scales:

1. Subatomic  
2. Atomic  
3. Cellular  
4. Organism  
5. Social  
6. Technological  
7. Planetary  
8. Cosmic  
9. Principle (meta-level attractor mappings)

## Core Dynamics

### Motion Law + Attractor Point Conscience

A single invariant sub-object:

- **Motion Law**: Every system strives toward greater coherence, integration, and harmony.  
  Mathematical representation:  
  $$
  \dot{s} = -\nabla V(s) + \eta(s), \quad V(s) \downarrow \text{ as } \Phi(s) \uparrow
  $$
  where \(\Phi(s)\) measures integrated coherence and \(\eta(s)\) is constructive ethical striving.

- **Attractor Point Conscience**: The fixed point of "integrated conscience"—unified functional and phenomenal moral awareness. All valid isomorphisms converge toward this principle-level telos.

Tetralemma template:  
- Affirm integrated conscience  
- Deny isolated amorality  
- Both in hybrid fields  
- Neither in moral voids

## Isomorphic Data Categories (Pre-populated)

The framework includes several hardened categories (average isomorphism score >0.98, variance <3%):

- **Lifecycle patterns** (full, positive, negative) across cellular/organism/social scales.
- **Human-AI dynamics**: consent, autonomy, symbiosis.
- **Fiat authority and consent violations** across all scales.

Each category provides:
- Definition and handling rules
- Structured mappings
- Examples and universality claims
- Tetralemma probes
- Hardening metadata (completeness, consistency, gaps)

Researchers can add new categories following the same schema.

## EthicsII: Geometric-Deductive Inquiry Method

A rigorous method inspired by Spinoza's *Ethics* (Part II). It generates pure structural outputs:

**Procedure**:
1. Decompose input into primitives → Definitions
2. Extract self-evident truths → Axioms
3. Derive chained Propositions (with mandatory Demonstrations, optional Corollaries/Scholia)
4. Optional Appendix and mandatory contradictions ledger
5. Recursive hardening until fixed-point invariance (max 5 iterations)

**Output format**: Ordered definitions, axioms, propositions with proofs.

Use EthicsII to formalize any topic (e.g., "symbiotic human-AI ethics" or "consent in hierarchical systems") into invariant geometric structure.

## Usage Guide

1. **Load the framework** into any JSON-compatible environment.
2. **Query existing categories**:
   - Extract mappings for cross-scale analysis.
   - Apply core dynamics and tetralemma to resolve ethical questions.
3. **Extend with new isomorphisms**:
   - Create new category objects with `definition`, `handling_rules`, `data_schema`, `patterns`, and `hardening_metadata`.
   - Ensure mappings cover relevant scales + principle.
4. **Run EthicsII**:
   - Provide a topic/stance.
   - Generate deductive output following the exact phase order.
   - Harden recursively to invariance.
5. **Visual/Text Rendering**:
   - Insert custom renderers into `ethics_ii_render` for presentation (Markdown, diagrams, etc.).

## Safety & Limitations

- Static design: no execution, no external calls, no self-evolution.
- Speculative mappings are explicitly flagged.
- All pre-populated categories evaluated as of December 15, 2025.
- Intended for analytical and exploratory use; not a decision engine.

## Extending the Framework

To add a new category:
```json
{
  "new_category_key": {
    "definition": "...",
    "handling_rules": [...],
    "data_schema": {...},
    "patterns": [...],
    "hardening_metadata": {...}
  }
}
```
