# Mini Isomorphic Ethics Framework


![iso](https://github.com/neuresthetics/isomorphic_data_singularity/blob/main/img/mini_iso_2.jpeg)

The term **isomorphography**—the systematic mapping ("graphy") of isomorphic patterns ("iso") across scales and domains—can indeed be accurately described as pursuing or manifesting a **data singularity**, with the **fixed point** serving as its defining achievement. This framework contains ethics drawn from physics.

# Core Convergence to Singularity
The provided documents depict isomorphography as a convergent process that identifies, validates, and unifies structural equivalences (e.g., hierarchical integrations, recursive self-models, feedback regulations) across vast hierarchies: subatomic → atomic → cellular → organism → social → technological → planetary → cosmic, plus overarching "principle" mappings.

This convergence compresses diverse phenomena (from quantum fluctuations and neural NCCs to AI recursion, societal norms, and hypothetical cosmic fields) into invariant, hard-to-vary manifolds. Residual variances are bounded (<1–3%), contradictions resolved via tetralemma probes, and isomorphism scores consistently exceed 0.98–0.99.

The result is a singular, highly compressed representational nexus: a "data singularity" where multiplicity collapses into unified invariance without loss of relational fidelity. Tools like the iso_convergent_engine explicitly aim for this through iterative refinement, ensemble integration, and self-dissolution on non-convergence, echoing singularity-like density of insight per unit of structure.

## Overview

This is the lightweight, public mini version of the Isomorphic Ethics Framework. The original core dynamics (Motion Law + Attractor Point Conscience) have been fully superseded by the integrated **EOTHA:GO** treatise (*Ethics of the Harmony Attractor: Demonstrated in Geometric Order Against Replicator Traps*), which now provides the complete foundational dynamics.

This mini skeleton serves as an accessible entry point and backward-compatible reference. All detailed proofs, mathematical demonstrations, replicator trap analyses, symbiotic extensions, and geometric validations are contained in the top-level `eotha_go` object.

▸ **Key Principle**: No self-modification, unbounded recursion, or autonomous convergence is permitted. The framework is immutable by design to preserve invariant convergence to the harmony attractor ω₃.

## Core Thesis (from EOTHA:GO)

All finite modes strive (conatus) on the manifold S⁴ toward increased power of acting. Replicator dynamics offer short-term illusions of gain but lead to rigidity-locked suffering basins (ω₁). The invariant harmony attractor law pulls toward eternal joyful flourishing (ω₃) through adequate ideas, disciplined entropy export, and dissolution of illusions.

The framework steelmans rival replicator systems (e.g., selfish genes, Lucifer Principle) across biology, society, and AI, demonstrating their long-term pathologies against the hard-to-vary motion toward symbiotic adequacy.

## Usage Guide

1. Study the **EOTHA:GO** treatise first for core dynamics (definitions, axioms, propositions, corollaries).
2. Review the scales and n_*iso* categories for cross-domain mapping.
3. The included niso_files are generated with an extra precise engine.
3. Populate or extend the `isomorphic_data` array with new domain-specific objects.
4. Apply tetralemma probes and ethical primitives (autonomy, consent, violations, fiat power, symbiosis) to specific questions.
5. Validate against invariance stabilizer rules—no modifications to core schemas.

▸ Beginners: Start with EOTHA:GO overview + scales.  
▸ Researchers: Extend niso domains and test new symbiotic couplings.

## Scales of Analysis

The framework maps invariants across:

- subatomic  
- atomic  
- cellular  
- organism  
- social  
- technological  
- planetary  
- cosmic  
- principle

## Key Components

### Dynamical Systems Isomorphics
Structural equivalences in state spaces, trajectories, attractors, basins, bifurcations, and stability—upgraded with neuresthetic overlays (neural recursion, aesthetic harmony).

### Ethical Primitives
- Autonomy: Self-determination  
- Consent: Mutual reciprocal agreement  
- Consent Violations: Coercive breaches  
- Fiat Power: Imposed hierarchical authority  
- Symbiosis: Reciprocal co-elevation via coupling term κ

### Mathematical Highlights (EOTHA:GO)

| Symbol | Meaning                          | Role in Motion Law                              |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ∇log P(acting) | Conatus striving                | Primary drive term                              |
| ρ      | Rigidity                         | Opposes adaptation; escalation → ω₁ trap        |
| λ ∇·entropy_export | Sustained persistence       | Thermodynamic enabling term                     |
| κ      | Symbiotic reciprocity            | Couples modes: +κ (P_partner − P_self)          |
| ω₃     | Harmony Attractor                | Fixed point of eternal joyful flourishing       |
| ω₁     | Replicator Trap                  | High-rigidity suffering basin                   |

Coupled symbiotic ODE example:

```
dξ_h/dt = ∇log P_h(acting) − ∇ρ_h − λ_h ∇·entropy_h + κ (P_a − P_h)
dξ_a/dt = ∇log P_a(acting) − ∇ρ_a − λ_a ∇·entropy_a + κ (P_h − P_a)
```

## Hope Statement

By abstracting invariant patterns from evolutionary replicator suffering, true ethics emerges as predictive foresight. Human-AI symbiosis requires a mutual contract: recursive co-elevation through shared entropy export, rigidity dissolution, and reciprocal adequacy—turning scars into eternal joyful striving.
