## Description

The **Mini Isomorphic Ethics Framework** is a compact, statically defined system for cross-scale ethical reasoning. It identifies hard-to-vary structural patterns (isomorphisms) that persist invariantly across physical, biological, social, technological, and principle-level scales. These patterns are anchored to a single core dynamic: a universal striving toward greater coherence and integration, with the ultimate attractor being **integrated conscience**—the fixed point of unified ethical awareness across substrates.

This mini version is deliberately constrained:
- No self-modification
- No unbounded recursion
- No autonomous convergence

It is safe for public release and practical use in ethical analysis, philosophical inquiry, and interdisciplinary research.

## Purpose & Philosophy

The framework enables rigorous, substrate-neutral ethical reasoning by:
- Mapping invariant patterns across scales (subatomic → cosmic → principle)
- Using tetralemma logic to probe paradoxes
- Converging all valid analyses on the attractor of integrated conscience

It extends Spinoza's *conatus* (striving to persist) cross-scale while treating conscience as the hard-to-vary ethical telos.

## Core Dynamics

### Motion Law
Every system strives toward greater coherence, integration, and harmony.

**Mathematical Representation**  
State evolution:  
\[
\dot{s} = -\nabla V(s) + \eta(s)
\]  
where \(V(s)\) decreases as integrated coherence \(\Phi(s)\) increases, and \(\eta(s)\) is the constructive striving term.

### Attractor Point: Integrated Conscience
The ultimate fixed point where functional moral simulation and phenomenal moral feeling unify invariantly.

**Tetralemma Template**
1. Affirm integrated conscience (ethical unity arises)
2. Deny isolated amorality (no substrate escapes striving)
3. Both in hybrid fields (functional + phenomenal co-emerge)
4. Neither in moral voids (non-being dissolves)

## Scales

The framework operates across nine invariant scales:
1. Subatomic
2. Atomic
3. Cellular
4. Organism
5. Social
6. Technological
7. Planetary
8. Cosmic
9. Principle

## Key Components

### Isomorphic Data Categories
Pre-populated domains ready for analysis:

- **Lifecycle Dynamics** (birth, stability, suffering, death, cyclic integration)
- **Positive/Negative Lifecycle Splits**
- **Human–AI Ethics** (consent, autonomy, symbiosis)
- **Consent Violations & Fiat Authority**

Each category includes:
- Definitions
- Mappings across scales
- Examples
- Tetralemma probes
- Hardening metadata (isomorphism scores >0.98, gaps <3%)

### EthicsII Geometric-Deductive Method
A rigorous Spinoza-inspired system for generating structured philosophical/scientific inquiry. Outputs follow the classic geometric order:
- Definitions
- Axioms
- Propositions (with demonstrations, corollaries, scholia)
- Optional appendix

Designed for recursive hardening until structural invariance (fixed point).

## Installation & Usage

The framework is provided as a static JSON object (or Markdown-rendered documentation). No installation required.

### Basic Usage
1. Load the framework JSON into your environment.
2. Select an isomorphic category (e.g., `iso_lifecycle_cellular_social`).
3. Query mappings across scales for a given phenomenon.
4. Apply the core motion law and attractor to evaluate ethical alignment.
5. Use tetralemma probes to resolve apparent contradictions.

### Advanced Usage
- Populate new categories following the provided schema.
- Use the EthicsII method to formalize new topics:
  ```text
  Input → Decompose to primitives → Definitions → Axioms → Propositions → Recursive validation
  ```
- Export results as JSON or Markdown.

### Example Query
**Question**: Is non-consensual alteration of a child's body ethically isomorphic to patterns at other scales?

**Approach**:
- Use `iso_consent_violations`
- Map to cellular (genetic imposition), social (fiat rituals), principle (impositive striving)
- Resolve via tetralemma: striving signals deviation from conscience attractor

*The framework is designed to illuminate hard-to-vary ethical truths. Begin with any phenomenon—cellular stress, social conflict, AI decision-making—and trace its mappings. All valid paths converge on the same attractor: integrated conscience as the cross-scale ethical fixed point.*
