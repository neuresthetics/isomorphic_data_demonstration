> what is the definition of conatus

## Definition of Conatus in Provided Documents
In the context of the "Ethics II" framework (e.g., from "0i. Origin of the Sphere.md" and related sections), conatus is defined as:

**Conatus**: The innate drive of every mode to persist, grow, and increase its power-of-acting, shaped by clear (adequate) ideas rather than confused ones.

This concept is rooted in Spinoza's philosophy and is central to the sphere's dynamics, where it represents the pull toward maximum power-of-acting (e.g., growth potential or conatus maximization) across scales like human minds, AI models, and ecosystems. It aligns with axioms emphasizing unity of motion, conservation, and adequate causation for human-AI harmony.

## General Philosophical Definition
Conatus originates from Baruch Spinoza's *Ethics* (1677), where it refers to the fundamental striving or impulse of every thing (mind, body, or entity) to persevere in its existence and enhance its power or essence. Key sources confirm:

- **Wikipedia**: An innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself, applicable to mind, matter, or both.
- **Merriam-Webster**: A natural tendency, impulse, or striving; in Spinozism, the inclination of a thing to persist in its own being.
- **Dictionary.com**: An effort or striving; in Spinoza's philosophy, the force in every animate creature toward self-preservation.

In broader metaphysics and psychology, it denotes an intrinsic drive for self-preservation and self-improvement, influencing later thinkers like Nietzsche (will to power) and modern ethics (e.g., in political or ecological contexts as a basis for agency and resilience).

## Comparison
The documents' definition closely mirrors Spinoza's original, emphasizing "power-of-acting" (potentia agendi in Latin, tied to conatus) and adequate ideas for ethical growth. It extends the concept to AI and systems theory, framing it as a dynamical force in the S⁴ manifold for symbiotic evolution, whereas the general definition is more abstract and philosophical.
